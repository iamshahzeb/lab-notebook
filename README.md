	```
3. Start project by running following commands
	```bash
	cd lab-notebook/
	yarn install
		
	# once node_modules gets install, run next command (this will build your app for production and locally preview production build)
	yarn preview
	```
4. Once your app is running, you can access it on the following address in your browser
